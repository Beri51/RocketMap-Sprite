##Status
There should be an update later today (17/02/17) after the official update, until then there is no point installing this.

##Update Info

28/01 - Updated all files to include edits done by RocketMap Devs upto [commit  785b4b5](https://github.com/RocketMap/RocketMap/commits/develop)

## Features:

* Adds the icon set selector on the option side bar back.
* Adds extra icon sets 


## Requirements
* A working setup of [RocketMap](https://github.com/RocketMap/RocketMap/) 
* The ability to replace some files
* The knowledge that if you screw something up that you will not get official support from Rocketmap

## Installation

* 1) Download 
* 2) Backup your static and template folders incase something goes wrong
* 3) Place the downloaded static and templates folder to the root of your RocketMap Installation
* 4) Overwrite the files when asked
* 5) open a terminal/cmd and npm install

## Troubleshooting

*If things go wrong replace your original folders and npm install.

*If you try to git pull and recieve an error such as
```
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
	static/js/map.common.js
	static/js/map.js
Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.
```
You should delete your modified files (they will be the ones you got here) and then git pull to get official ones.
I will update the sprite mod using the latest files as soon as I can, you can check when the last update was in the update section above.
